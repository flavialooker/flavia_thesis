# Thesis Proposal

Airbnb was found in 2008 and sooner become a popular platform to provide people places to rent all over the 191 countries. Through Airbnb peer to peer platform people could connect easily to monetise their spare space and unlock a world of accommodation options available. Airbnb platform also offers experiences, but for the context of this Thesis, we will only include data on accommodations listed on the platform.

The data was downloaded from Kaggle and it is a year time frame from August 2018 to August 2019. The dataset retrieves information on Airbnb listing located in Ireland.

I was a host myself in Airbnb for a couple of months and If I had access to this type of dataset beforehand, it would have been helpful to position my listing according to the market offerings. Assumptions are made stating that Airbnb has been increasing sharply from the past years. Some part of the population might be getting advantages of the platform and some might be blaming it to worsen the house crisis in Ireland. So, I thought this dataset could be useful to get insights on how popular Airbnb is in Dublin and the proportions this type of business is getting here. Moreover, if there is a business opportunity trend within Airbnb in Dublin, how likely this is affecting the housing crisis in Dublin

So, some of the areas I would like to explore with this dataset would be:

<ul>
<li>Prices changes according to neighbourhoods and number of available listings. </li>
<li>If a specific location has a very high number of listing, is there any characteristic in the area that might be contributing to this</li>
<li>The average price for distinct listings offerings (single, private room or entire home)</li>
<li>Is that a specific time of the year that is most likely to be fully booked and, if yes, are the prices changeable according to such events?</li>
<li>Whatâ€™s the highest occupancy neighbourhood and lowest?</li>
<li>What good and bad reviews could say</li>
<li>What is the monthly average in Airbnb Listing compared to Daft.ie</li>
<li><small>Any other trends?</li></small>
