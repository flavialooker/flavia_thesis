# Thesis Proposal

Airbnb was founded in 2008 and quickly became a popular platform to provide people with places to rent in towns and cities in 191 countries. Through the Airbnb peer to peer platform people could easily connect to monetise spare space and unlock a world of accommodation options to willing travellers. The Airbnb platform also now offers experiences, but for the purpose of this Thesis, we will only include data on the accommodation listed on the platform.

The data used for this Thesis was downloaded from Kaggle[.com]and provides a year of data from August 2018 to August 2019. The dataset is based on Airbnb listings located in Ireland.

I was a host myself on Airbnb for a period of time and if I had access to this type of dataset beforehand, it would have been helpful to position my listing according to the market offerings. Assumptions are made stating that Airbnb usage has been increasing sharply from the past years. Some part of the population might be getting advantages from the platform and some may be blaming it for the worsening housing crisis in Ireland. So, I thought this dataset could be useful to get insights on how popular Airbnb business is in Dublin. Moreover, if there is a business opportunity trend for Airbnb in Dublin, how likely this affecting the housing crisis in Dublin is.

<b>Some of the areas I would like to explore with this dataset would be:</b>
<ul>
<li>Prices changes according to neighbourhoods and number of available listings. </li>
<li>If a specific location has a very high number of listing, is there any characteristic in the area that might be contributing to this</li>
<li>The average price for distinct listings offerings (single, private room or entire home)</li>
<li>Are the prices changeable according to seasons of Events in Town?</li>
<li>Whatâ€™s the highest occupancy neighbourhood and lowest?</li>
<li>What is the monthly average in Airbnb Listing compared to Daft.ie</li>
<li><small>Any other trends?</li></small>
